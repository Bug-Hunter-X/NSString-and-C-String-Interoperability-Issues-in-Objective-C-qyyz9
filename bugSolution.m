To avoid these issues, always ensure proper memory management and handle null terminators carefully. Here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
char *cString = "Hello, world!";
NSString *objCString = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:cString];
// ... some operations ...
const char *newCString = [objCString UTF8String]; // Note: const char*
// ... further operations using newCString ...

//If you need to modify newCString, you have to copy the string
char *mutableCString = strdup(newCString);
// ... operations on mutableCString...
free(mutableCString);

//or use a mutableCopy
NSMutableString *mutableObjCstring = [objCString mutableCopy];
[mutableObjCstring setString:@"modified string"];
const char* newCString2 = [mutableObjCstring UTF8String];
```

This revised version uses `const char*` to indicate that the string shouldn't be modified directly, preventing accidental modification of the memory allocated by `UTF8String`. If you need a mutable copy you should make it explicitly using `strdup` and always remember to call `free` to release the allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.  Using `mutableCopy` on the NSString object also prevents issues with the immutability of NSString objects.
