In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSString` objects and their interaction with C strings (null-terminated character arrays).  The problem often manifests when attempting to convert between these two representations without careful handling of memory management and null terminators. For instance, consider the following code:

```objectivec
char *cString = "Hello, world!";
NSString *objCString = [NSString stringWithUTF8String:cString];
// ... some operations ...
char *newCString = [objCString UTF8String];
// ... further operations using newCString ...
```

The seemingly innocuous conversion from `NSString` back to `char*` using `UTF8String` can lead to issues.  `UTF8String` returns a pointer to a newly allocated buffer (which needs to be released manually using `free()`), and failure to do so results in memory leaks. Another, and more insidious, error is if the original `cString` was not properly null-terminated, or if the resulting `NSString` contains characters that cannot be represented in UTF-8.
